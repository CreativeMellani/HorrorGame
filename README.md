Intro/ epilgoue 

You are at a local house party with your closest friends. The music is blaring, just about everyone at the party is dancing in the living room where furniture has been move around to form a dance floor. Dancing all night has made you thirsty, you make your way to the kitchen to grab a drink. As you make your way into the kitchen, you hear a blood curdling scream that pierces through the loud sound of the music. Your attention turn to where the scream’s originated . Amy, one of the popular girls from high school, emerges from one of the house’s dark hallways. Suddenly the music is silent, everyone is frozen staring at Amy who’s now at the entrance of the hallway. Amy’s eyes are wide open staring back at everyone at in the crowd, she then looks down. Amy’s been stabbed, a knife has been plunged into Amy’s stomach. Frozen with shock, the crowd continues to stare at Amy as she reaches down to grab the knife and takes it out of her stomach. Blood starts to ooze out of Amy’s stomach and immediately Amy passes out and collapses onto the floor. As Amy’s body collapses onto the floor the kitchen’s landline telephone rings.
